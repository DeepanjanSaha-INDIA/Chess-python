# Chess-python

The GUI was implemented using Tkinter module present (by default) in python.

## Getting Started

The basic knowledge of chess game is the only prerequisites required. Most of the rules of chess, some ofwhich are Check condition, Checkmate condition, En-passant rule, Castling condition, Pawn promotion condition etc are implemented in the code. Also all possible places where pieces can move gets coloured on selecting a piece (thus providing hints to players).

Status message gets displayed beside the game to help player analyse the special conditions attained. All the pieces which are  being displayed are the images present in the directory along with the main file i.e, `Chess.ipynb`, and renaming the names of the images will lead to image not being loaded.

## Installing
